# Brain Tumor Segmentation

## Overview

This repository contains code for brain tumor segmentation using both machine learning and deep learning approaches. The primary objective of this project is to accurately segment brain tumors from medical images.

## Approaches

- **Machine Learning Approach**:
  Utilizes traditional machine learning techniques for tumor segmentation.

- **Deep Learning Approach**:
  Implements advanced deep learning models for improved segmentation.
  - **Note**: The deep learning model has not yet converged due to limited computational resources. Fine-tuning of the `DeepLab` model is currently in progress to enhance performance.

## Status

- **Deep Learning different Approach**: The model is under active development.  fine-tuning the `DeepLab` model to achieve better results.
