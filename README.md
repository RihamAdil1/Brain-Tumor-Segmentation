# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation
Brain Tumor Segmentation
This repository contains code for brain tumor segmentation using machine learning and deep learning approaches.

Overview
The goal of this project is to segment brain tumors from medical images. Two approaches have been employed:

Machine Learning Approach: Utilizes traditional machine learning techniques for segmentation.

Deep Learning Approach: Implements deep learning models for more advanced segmentation. Currently, the deep learning model has not converged due to limited computational resources.

Status
Deep Learning Approach: The model is in progress and is undergoing fine-tuning. Currently, the DeepLab model is being fine-tuned to improve performance.
